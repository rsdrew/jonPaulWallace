  - highlightedBlurb1: JonPaul’s story
    blurb1: >-
      started in a small town in Michigan, north of Detroit. JonPaul followed in
      the footsteps of his sister, Rocky Wallace, in pursuing a career as an
      artist.
    highlightedBlurb2: 'Singing since 6 years old,'
    blurb2: >-
      he saw his first glimpse of worldwide attention when a video of him
      performing his rendition of “7 Years” by Lukas Graham at his high school
      graduation surfaced on the internet. The video was captured by a
      classmate’s father and uploaded online, unbeknown to JonPaul. That video
      quickly started circulating the internet, generating over 20 million views
      worldwide.

  - highlightedBlurb1: 'Following that craze,'
    blurb1: >-
      JonPaul catapulted along his journey to discovering who he is as a person,
      and as an artist. He has dialed in his style as a writer, a singer, a

      played hundreds of shows around Michigan and beyond.
    highlightedBlurb2: Some notable shows

  - highlightedBlurb1: JonPaul’s current full band
    blurb1: >-
      performance setup consists of himself on keyboards, guitar, and vocals;
      Anthony Fiolek on drums; Ryan Haley on guitar and bass. This trio brings

  - highlightedBlurb1: Another current project
    blurb1: >-
      curated by JonPaul and his team is the “Live from Nonna’s House” video
      series. In this series, JonPaul and his friends got together to create
      personal, intimate, stripped-down performances in JonPaul’s Nonna’s living
      room.
    highlightedBlurb2: The idea of the project
    blurb2: >-
      is to invite collaborators and viewers into the very personal space where
      JonPaul experienced a lot of fond, core memories in his childhood. It also
      portrays JonPaul’s music in a light that is quite different from his live
      shows. His shows are traditionally very high energy and full speed,
      whereas in the “Live from Nonna’s House” performances, the band can scale
      back and create a more intimate performance.
